Currently, we need the following:

#. A **guide for filling and mailing the paper version** of the 
   "Kannatusilmoitus". We also need the actual form PDF, preferably a 
   very small PDF file (<50-100kB), which prints nicely.
   (Already done, but the page could be a little bit more graphic.)

#. **Swedish translation.**

#. Rework the **events table** so that we have a **single source** for it. 
   Preferably in a JSON format, which gets read by build.py.

#. Add **media quotations** and links to media articles at home and abroad.
   This increases the "social proof" of the campaign. This section 
   could be *after the summary* and *before the events table*.
   Also add the original starters and supporters of the proposal:

#. Make the buttons of the same size and center them properly.
